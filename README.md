[Sample Deployed at GitHub Pages](https://n-kimberly.github.io/whole-latte-music/home.html)

## Background

Whole Latte Music allows users to navigate through music libraries to play, pause, index, and seek through songs in a playlist in an intuitive and interactive way.

## Project Goals

My goal with Bloc Jams was to incorporate the five user stories designated by Bloc’s Web Developer Bootcamp curriculum. In doing so, I sought to improve my overall competency in HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to use the site on mobile.
2. As a user, I want to play, pause, and index through songs.
3. As a user, I want to see information about my music, including album title, song title, song length, and artist name.
4. As a user, I want to navigate through my song’s seek bar.
5. As a user, I want to control the volume of this application.
